Thymeleaf Interactive Tutorial Web Application
==============================================

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Project info
------------

The Thymeleaf Interactive Tutorial is a web application distributed as a `.war`
file that you should deploy into a java web server (Apache Tomcat 7.0+ recommended),
typically by copying this `.war` file to the server's `webapps` folder.

You will need to access files with a text editor inside the web application *once
deployed*, so *your web server should be local*.
